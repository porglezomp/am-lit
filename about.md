This blog is intended to allow me to write about what I'm doing in English so that I don't have to come up with ideas all at once. I'm making it as part of my series of "books" that I'm making with github pages to use as notes or other things for my classes this year. The other ones can be found at [my github page](https://porglezomp.github.io).

This blog is built upon [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) using the [Jekyll new theme](github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new). The source for jekyll can be found at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
