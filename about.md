This blog is intended to allow me to write about what I'm doing in English so that I don't have to come up with ideas all at once. I'm making it as part of my series of "books" that I'm making with github pages to use as notes or other things for my classes this year. The other sites can be found at [my github page](https://porglezomp.github.io). My English class can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/a/aaps.k12.mi.us/fitzgerald-classes/).

This blog is built upon [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) using the [Jekyll new theme](github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new). The source for jekyll can be found at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), and the source for this book can be found at [github.com/porglezomp/am-lit](https://github.com/porglezomp/am-lit).
