I feel like writing some notes about the concrete solid analysis things we've learned so far. This here will basically be a transcription of the notes. We've learned that the analysis of the literature is based on looking at the _elements of literature_. These elements are:

- Plot
- Character
- Conflict
- Setting
- Point of View
- Symbolism
- Theme
- Language and Style

What follows is some short and basic description of each one.

### Plot is...
A series of related events that drive the story. The plot typically flows from exposition, to the rising action, the climax, falling action, then deneumont.

Plot can be anylized by looking at how it's structured. Why does it follow the order that it does, and is that order chronological? How is the central conflict presented and resolved? Are there flashbacks? If so, what purpose to they serve? How is the structure used to get an emtional response?

### Characters are...
The **protagonist** is the central character, and their conflict is the central conflict.  
The **antagonist** is the force in conflict with the protagonist. It doesn't have to be another person.

The characters can be described with their traits: Their physical description, thoughts, actions, reactions of other characters towards them, and the narrator directly telling us things.

Dynamic characters change throughout the story, static characters don't.

### Conflict is...
A struggle between opposing forces, physical, intellectual, moral, or emotional. Sometimes a big mix of these things.

**Internal conflict** is a person vs themself, and **external conflict** is a person vs another.  
The climax is the turning point, the highest point of tension or suspense.

Determine two things about conflict:
- Is it internal or external?
- What does it say about humans in general?

### Setting is...
Place and time, can include the social setting, etc. Exposition is establishing the setting and point of view. It sets the set the stage.

### Point of View is...
Perspective. Is it first or third? Is the narrator a character? Are they objective? How limited is their perception? Why do they tell the story the way they do?

### Symbols are...
Tengible representations of something intangible. If they're repeatedly assosciation is a motif. Some symbols are simply universally recognized.

### Theme is...
The underlying message in a work. How does the author represent the theme? Ask yourself what the author is saying about being human with the theme.

### Language and Style...

**Tone** is Attitude toward the subject matter.

**Figurative language** is language containing figures of speech, it's not literal and must be interpreted.

**Denotaiton** is the literal meaning of something.

**Connotation** is the meaning beyond the literal meaning.

Some figurative devices:

- Metaphor
- Simile
- Personification
- Hyperbole
- Understatement
- Idiom

**Irony** is unexpected contrast.

## That's all folks!
That's the notes we've taken recently.

I'll be adding some new stuff into the portfolio, so look out for that.
