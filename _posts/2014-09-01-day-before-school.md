It's the day before school, and I'm just starting to work to work on this blog.

## What this blog is

This blog is intended to allow me to write about what I'm doing in English so that I don't have to come up with ideas all at once. I'm making it as part of my series of "books" that I'm making with github pages to use as notes or other things for my classes this year. The other ones can be found at [my github page](https://porglezomp.github.io).

## How it's going to be organized

This blog should contain general musings on my work. If I have some thoughts about discussion in class, or about what we're reading, I can write it here to use as reference when I need to finally write a paper or something else like that.

Perhaps this will make English class more fun. School starts tomorrow. I wonder how I'll handle this year.
