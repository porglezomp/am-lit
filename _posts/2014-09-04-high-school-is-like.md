Every day in English class, we're given a prompt which we have to write about for 10 minutes starting as soon as the bell rings. I very much enjoyed my response to today's prompt because I produced a very surreal peice of writing. I reproduce it here in a slightly edited form. Today's prompt was...

## High School is Like [something],  Because ...

High school is like pancakes, because it's much better if you place a huge pat of butter on top of it, let the butter slowly melt into the hot tar on the roof, and then drown the whole thing in syrup.

High school is like a journey, because you have to carry a lot of heavy supplies, and pretty quickly your back and feet get sore, and to make it worse you always have some kid who keeps asking "Are we there yet?" but who doesn't really care about the destination, just about getting the journey over with, because they're getting tired already.

High school is like a bee, because it produces honey and can sting you if you disturb its nest. Have you ever seen a swarm of high schools? Those things are *huge!* They could seriously mess somebody up with all those stingers of theirs, some of them are the size of flagpoles! Some of them *are* flagpoles! *Man!*

High school is like a delicate flower, because lots of people laugh at it and refuse to take it seriously simply because they're insecure in their image as a cool person, believing that cool people cannot enjoy schools/flowers. Also, this one is a delightful shade of purple, and is surrounded by grassy fields.

High school is like a skinny cardboard box, because it's hilarious when cats try to stuff themselves inside one and then make the whole thing topple over.

High school is like a honeydew melon, but I can't tell you why. That's classified.
