As you can see in the top bar of the site, I've added a portfolio section. This is because we're required to make an online portfolio for class, so it will be filling up with my work and changing layout pretty soon. We were told to use google sites, but I got express permission to use this site here.Perhaps it will make it harder on myself, but it will be far more fun.

_P.S._

Also, my teacher is convinced that I will someday have to use google sites. I'm not sure if this is at all true (I personally doubt that many companies use google sites even for internal purposes) but google sites certainly has gotten a lot better than last time I looked at it.
