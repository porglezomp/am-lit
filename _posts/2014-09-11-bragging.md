Twice each year we have to take an online "reading" (actually vocabulary) test called the SRI. It uses some dynamic method to keep you going until it figures out what your score should be. If your score is obvious, then it's fast, if there's a delicate balance of what vocabulary you know, it takes longer. We took this test yesterday in the library computer lab. So, everyone sat down and tried to get to the page which ran it, it took some people longer than others because of poor interface on the AAPS site. Then, while the last people were finishing logging in, I got up and left the room, having already finished my test.

I completed it with a 1700+ (the highest score it can measure) in just 4 questions.
