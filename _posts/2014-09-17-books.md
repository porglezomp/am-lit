Yesterday we got the first two books we're going to read, _The Crucible_ and _The Scarlet Letter_. It seems that the theme of our first unit is "we're Puritans and also jerks."
I'm sure the books are very good, but I don't know that much about them, besides the fact that they're about people being horrible to each other effectively because of peer pressure.

We also started reading a short story today. It's by the author of the _The Scarlet Letter_, Nathaniel Hawthorne. This story is different, it's about making barely concealed allusions that one of the characters is actually Satan.
